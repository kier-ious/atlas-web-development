## What is CSS
CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation
of a document written in HTML. It enables web developers to apply styling attributes
such as colors, fonts and spacing to visually enhance the appeal of the web page.

## How to add style to an element
This concept involves using CSS rules to apply styles to HTML elements. Styles can
include properties like color, font size, margin and more. Developers can target specific
elements or groups of elements to control their appearance.

## What is a Class
In CSS, a class is a way to group HTML elements and apply styles to them collectively.
Classes allow developers to apply the same styling to multiple elements without duplicating
code, promoting a more organized and efficient coding structure.

## What is a Selector
Selectors in CSS are patterns used to select and style HTML elements. They define the elements
to which a style rule should apply. Selectors can target elements based on their
tag name, class, ID, attributes, and more.

## How to Compute CSS Specificity Value
CSS specificity determines which style rules should take precedence when there are conflicting
styles. It is calculated based on the combination of selectors used in a rule. Understanding
specificity is crucial for resolving styling conflicts in a web page.

## Box Properties in CSS
Box properties in CSS refer to the dimensions and spacing of an element. Key box properties
include width, height, margin (space outside the element), and padding (space inside the element).
Properly managing box properties is essential for creating well-structured layouts.

## How Does the Browser Load a Webpage
The browser follows a series of steps to load and render a webpage. It starts by fetching the
HTML content, then parses and constructs the Document Object Model (DOM). After that, it fetches
and processes CSS styles, and finally, it renders the page. Understanding this process helps
developers optimize webpage performance.
